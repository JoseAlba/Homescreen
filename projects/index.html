						Inspiration
						<br>
						We wanted to create a website that had the ease of use like the usual e-commerce chains like Amazon or Ebay, with an integration into supporting the exchange of cryptocurrency technology.
						<br><br>

						What it does
						<br>
						Merchants who register on the site will have the ability to set up their own accounts for selling their own digital products or services in exchange for Bitcoin. Likewise, consumers who are in the market for purchasing digital content will have the ability to interface with these merchants and set up an exchange for goods and services.
						<br><br>
						Digital goods such as E-Books, PDFs, game keys, or services like freelancing work are accepted for trade.
						<br><br>

						How I built it
						<br>
						In the beginning, we set up the core of the site's features using PHP. We looked into our options on what would support an e-commerce site and utilized Cockroach DB for the ease of use of creating and maintaining scalable databases.
						<br>
						Next, we set out to look into the Coinbase API which would aid in creating an escrow system built into the site to ensure that all transactions were fairly met. The API would also perform functions like creating wallets and checkout pages for when you purchase a product on the site.
						<br><br>

						Challenges I ran into
						<br>
						It was the first time I had to work with AWS solutions which took a good chunk of time to set up before getting into the actual work at the beginning of the event. We also had a few issues with the Coinbase API in which prevented us from fully implementing into our website. Another big challenge to note is the efficient use of time as you balance the ratio between working on features that are needed and not wanted. Very important.
						<br><br>

						Accomplishments that I'm proud of
						<br>
						Working with a very talented team to accomplish a unified goal. Everyone on the team had their own talents and were able to collaborate efficiently and responsively. BitBuy allowed us to push beyond our developmental comfort zones and exceed our personal expectations.
						<br><br>

						What I learned
						<br>
						Planning and organizing are everything, especially in a time-constrained project that is this 32-hour hackathon. While it is good to discuss what project we will be working on at the start of the event, it's better to get things down on paper and construct a logical roadmap that all members of your team can comfortably acknowledge and work with.
						<br><br>

						What's next for BitBuy
						<br>
						Implementing APIs and finalizing features that have not been able to make it into the final cut before the deadline.
						<br><br>

						Built With
						PHP,
						Javascript
						HTML5
						CSS3
						CockroachDB

						Last year I accomplished so much that it seems almost impossible to find greater success this year. I was able to accomplish so much because I set smart short-term and long-term goals for myself. The reason I create short-term goals is because I use them as checkpoints in order to reach my long- term goals. Here is a list of my long-term goals and how I am going to fulfill these achievements.
						<br><br>
						One of my long-term goals is to travel Europe, which seems simple enough, but in order to do this I must have enough money saved or create a personal income during the experience. In order to create income during my trip, I am planning on creating videos while I travel Europe. This is because creating videos is a simple yet fun activity that could potentially become a way of generating passive income from ad monetization, as well as serve as great memories from my experience. Even if I do not generate ad revenue from my videos I can add the videos to my blog as additional content to attract new followers. I have invested in a GoPro camera and have been learning how to use it, and I’m ready to begin creating content.
						<br><br>
						Another long-term goal of mine is to improve my personal blog, through using more organized posting and new high-quality content, so that my following increases. I plan on making it better by splitting my monthly post into two different posts in order to make it more convenient and accessible for my followers. I also want to add videos of my experiences to my blog whenever I have the opportunity; this is another reason why I bought a GoPro.
						<br><br>
						My most important long-term goal is to acquire three different assets in order to make passive income. This is because I do not want to rely on a day job as my sole source of income for the rest of my life. I plan to start making passive income from my blog, by adding ads of the books I read about the stock market like Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. The reason I don’t currently have ads is because my current blog is actually just an extension of my biographical website josealba.org. I just bought a domain and pointed that domain to the extension of my website that contains my blog. This is why whenever you change pages the URL does not change. The reason I have not done this yet is because I don’t know if I want to rent another server to run my website. Another way I plan on making passive income is by investing in dividend stocks. I also want to make money from YouTube by adding my videos but this will be very hard so it will most likely be a different way.
						<br><br>
						I also want to get a job in Switzerland after my time on student exchange is done. This is because my Godmother and Godfather live in Zurich, Switzerland. If I am able to secure a job I would be able to live at their house, saving me money from rent. This would be amazing as the Swiss Franc is valued a lot more than the Canadian dollar and I would be able to continue traveling after my time on exchange is finished. If I am able to acquire a job in Switzerland, I will add a lot more money into my stock portfolio. I will pursue this opportunity by applying for jobs in Switzerland.
						<br><br>
						Another goal of mine is to develop apps for iPhone or Android smartphones. I want to do this as I study Computer Science, but have almost no knowledge of app development. By developing apps it will develop valuable new skills to add to my CV and I think it would be a project I would enjoy to work on.
						<br><br>
						Even though I have these short and long term goals, I will still accomplish my biggest goal which is to enjoy life. Now that I am in Europe I really want to take this opportunity to travel the European Union. I have looked into some volunteering opportunities the University of Essex has to offer and I’m very excited about all the opportunities this school has to offer. The only reason I would not travel is if I run out of money, which is why I plan to develop some passive income streams.

						<h2>ColourJS</h2>
						<p>A JavaScript tool to help manage colours. This library helps calculate colors to transition from color A to B to (optionally) C and so on... It can calculate analogous, complementary, primary, secondary, tertiary, warm or cool colors.</p>

						Inspiration
						<br>
						While developing a web-based oscilloscope using WebGL over the summer, I noticed the lack of functions to generate and manage colours in Javascript. The same thing applies to different data visualisation packages such as D3 and Dygraph.
						<br><br>

						What it does
						<br>
						-will calculate colors to transition from color A to B to (optionally) C and so on...
						<br>
						-calculates analogous, complementary, primary, secondary, and tertiary colors
						<br>
						-generate warm or cool colors
						<br><br>

						How we built it
						<br>
						-the app was built using mostly Javascript, and some AngularJS and HTML/CSS for testing purposes
						<br><br>

						Challenges we ran into
						<br>
						-aligning HTML elements using Zurb-Foundation
						<br>
						-scaling and increment/decrementing of R G and B values of source and destination colors over time
						<br><br>

						What we learned
						<br>
						-how to manage RGB and Hexadecimal colours
						<br>
						-calculate related colors
						<br>
						-convert between RGB to Hexadecimal with ease
						<br><br>

						What's next for ColourJS
						<br>
						Since the weekend was not nearly enough to finish and implement the library fully, we will release it as an open source project and continue to work on it throughout our school year.
						<br><br>

						Built With
						Javascript
						Angular.js
						Zurb-foundation

						<h2>Book Webpage</h2>

						New textbooks are expensive for the amount of time a student uses it. So, students resell their textbooks to recoup some of the costs and to help other students save some money. But the whole process of buying / selling used textbooks can be exhausting and time consuming. Having to find a buyer / seller, negotiating a price and scheduling a time to meet up all takes time out of the studentâ€™s busy life. Often, students donâ€™t even bother reselling their used textbooks which can hurt other students looking to save some money. This causes a domino effect that can impact the whole student body.
						<br><br>
						After we experienced this time consuming process of buying / selling used textbooks we decided to create this online service. Our goal is to become the middleman between the students buying / selling their used textbooks. We are achieving this through buying the students used textbooks and then reselling them to the other students. This allows students to interact with our flexible service instead of the other students.
						<br><br>
						Here at the University Book Store we try our best to keep our customers satisfied. We made the website very user friendly as this is key to keeping our customers happy. We implemented HTML and SQL injection attack prevention in order to protect your valuable information and keep it away from hackers. Our databases stores your information in a well mannered way and it repopulates the information incase any information is lost. To do this we inplemented the following programming languages inorder to do this website: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, PHP, XML, AJAX, XSLT. We plan on expanding this idea to other schools in the future. Contact us for more information.
