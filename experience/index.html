				<h2>Welcome to the University of Windsor</h2>
				<em>September 3rd, 2014</em>
				<p>
					When I started University I had very limited knowledge in Computer Science, but I had the ambition needed to succeed. I wanted to not only pass my classes, but thrive in them. During my first year of University the only thing I wanted to succeed in was school, and I ultimately dropped my hobbies and sports in order achieve this goal.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="03/04/2015">
				<h2>First Year Accomplishments</h2>
				<em>April 3rd, 2015</em>
				<p>
					On April 3rd, I received an award for academic excellence at the University of Windsor. This was a major milestone in my short time at Windsor as I had dedicated my life towards school. I also received bursaries for University and this motivated me towards working harder the year after, that way I could get scholarships instead of bursaries. I was also approved for co-op at my University and was excited for the summer break.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="03/09/2015">
				<h2>Summer Goals</h2>
				<em>September 3rd, 2015</em>
				<p>
					During my summer as a first year student, my friends from University and I opened a paper trading account to practice trading stocks. I started getting into the stock market as my friend told me I had potential. I also used to sell candy in high school and traded on Kijiji, so I started reading multiple books about the stock market and started reading the news more often. I also made it my goal to gain valuable work experience while at the same time maintain my average during the school year.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="13/12/2015">
				<h2>A Miracle Week</h2>
				<em>December 13th, 2015</em>
				<p>
					The 3rd week of December was my equivalent week to the miracle year for Albert Einstein. I gained my first two scholarships based on my grades which finally gave me the satisfaction that my hard work had paid off.
					<br><br>
					During this week I was also given the job position of a teaching assistant at the University and I was very pleased as this was the first experience I was going to gain in my field of study. This was also very pleasing as this job was very difficult to secure as a second year student. On top of these two great accomplishments, my persistency of asking every professor if they had a research position available finally paid off as a professor agreed to hire me as a research assistant once a position was available. Again this was a great success to my standards and I could clearly see my hard work was paying off!
					<br><br>
					Due to all this success in school and my paper trade account, I finally got the confidence to trade real money in the market. This lead to me opening a trading account via Questrade and I started trading the next month with real money.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="15/04/2016">
				<h2>One step forward two steps back</h2>
				<em>April 15th, 2016</em>
				<p>
					Near the end of my fourth semester at the University of Windsor, I was told by the company I was hired by that I couldn't work with them during the summer due to some internal issues. During this time I had already signed a lease for four months in order to work at the city this company was located. Since it was a binned contract I could not do anything about it. Plus, I was going to lose the valuable experience of getting real world experience. My co-op advisor told me during finals and since getting real world experience was more important than grades to me I dropped studying for my finals and focused all my energy to get another job before the summer started.
					<br><br>
					I stopped studying for finals which ultimately dropped my grades drastically. The co-op office at my University was also trying to help me in getting another job during this time, but we knew it would be hard to get the job experience so close into the summer as all the companies had already hired other students.
 					<br><br>
					In the end, I was lucky enough to get a summer job. Even though I was not programming it was something I knew that would help my professional career in the future. Earlier during the semester when I was applying for jobs I had a series of interviews. I had one interview even after I accepted my job for the company that dropped me. I did this interview in order to practice interviews for the future as this skill is vital to success. This company liked my interview and was going to offer me a position during the summer, but since I already had the other jobs they gave the job to another student. Although, when they heard that I was dropped by the company that was supposed to hire me, they decided to hire me in their Guelph offices.

				<h2>First Co-op Semester</h2>
				<em>August 22nd, 2016</em>
				<p>
					Section 1: Being a Professional
					<br><br>
					During my summer work term I had the opportunity to work for two sectors of the Canadian Government: the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC). Both institutions share similar goals – the governing and regulation of food production and safety standards in Canada. However, both departments are unique in their jurisdiction and specific functions. The CFIA is dedicated to the health and safety standards regarding food production, retail, and service in Canada. Their ultimate goal is to provide Canadians with a safe food environment by protecting humans, plants, and animals from unhealthy or unsafe food practices. CFIA achieves this by adhering to science-based standards and enforcing them in the food industry of Canada. Because the CFIA is a department of the Canadian government, there is no corporate competition.
					<br><br>
					AAFC deals with the agricultural production of food in Canada.  They are responsible to produce and enforce policies that govern agricultural income and production, the research and development of agricultural innovations, the inspection and regulation of plants and animals in an agricultural environment, and the regulation of rural development in Canada (Government of Canada, 2016). Like the CFIA, AAFC implicates these responsibilities by adhering to science-based standards in their work environment. Also like the CFIA, AAFC has no corporate competition due to the fact that it is a department of the Canadian government.
					<br><br>
					My placement during my time in the CFIA and AAFC was in information technology. Because modern offices rely heavily on technology in every department, my peers and I dealt with the entire CFIA office building, after which we would report to our supervisors. The role that information technologists play are a small but vital role in any office environment, and one that is increasingly common in our contemporary professional environment. In his book Computers in the Workplace, Robert Plotkin estimates that the rise of the internet and computers has created over 1.2 million jobs in the United States alone (2012). Today, even a miniscule error in the software or hardware of a machine can bring business to a complete halt. Therefore it was very important that my peers and I dealt with these errors quickly and effectively. As a worker for both AAFC and CFIA responsibility was to help with technical problems. I helped troubleshoot computers, phones, and other devices that contribute to the work flow of the department. This is very relevant to the company as everybody uses computers in the organizations. However, I found that not only is the role of information technology vital to the functionality and progressive output of an office space, it is also crucial to the happiness and morale of office workers. Problems with hardware and software can be extremely frustrating to the average worker; therefore I believe that my colleagues and my roles in the workplace contributed to the overall happiness – and subsequentially, the productivity (Shaw, 2015) – of the workplace.
					<br><br>
					A big part of my role in CFIA and AAFC was providing professional, courteous, and efficient service to every branch of both workplaces. As an information technologist I was expected to have the knowledge to diagnose problems in software and hardware, and work towards a solution with a team of other information technologists. Because these problems were often frustrating for the person experiencing them, it was very important to keep a calm and collected attitude. Because of this I believe that the one of the biggest qualities of being a professional in the workplace is the ability to keep a level head under stressful circumstances. There are very little workplaces where the average worker does not experience stressful situations. I believe that the difference between being professional and unprofessional lies in how one handles these stressful situations. Information technologists in particular deal with a lot of pressure on a daily basis. After all, the role that information technology plays in the workplace would not exist if the technology in a workplace constantly worked smoothly. I dealt almost exclusively with these problems during my time at CFIA and AAFC, therefore I had to be calm and collected in order to do my job correctly.
					<br><br>
					I believe integrity in the workplace comes from genuinely caring about your role in the working environment, and showing compassion for your colleagues. There are several ways in which this can be done. Giving credit where credit is due; working hard to fulfill your function in the workplace in order to contribute to the ultimate progress of the office; and taking the initiative to learn how to do your job to your full potential are the ways I would try and show integrity in my workplaces during the my placement. Integrity is a large part of professionalism – showing integrity also eases relations with colleagues and allows everybody to function better together. I found that the people I dealt with came to appreciate my hard work and motivation, because I strived to have integrity in my work habits.
					<br><br><br>

					Section 2: Skills and Work Experience
					<br><br>
					Time management is an essential part of any working environment. I found that my days as an information technologist were unstructured. I had to manage my own time, and every day was different – there were days where there was very little work to do, and there were days where large projects (such as a mass software update) or a string of technological failures would keep me busy. This resulted in me learning a lot about time management. Because I never knew how busy my work day would be, I would aim to complete my tasks as quickly and effectively as possible. Breaking up tasks into manageable components was a very important part of this. The work flow in an office environment can often seem overwhelming; however, I found that allotting time to individual tasks instead of attempting to complete all my tasks at once was one of the best ways to manage my time. This allowed me to focus completely on one things at a time, reducing errors and allowing me to work quicker. Recording how long it took me to complete certain tasks is also an efficient strategy to manage time. It is important to have an idea of how long a certain task will take you in the workplace, and I found recording time consumption for each task I was given helped me to manage my time better when a similar task would arise in the future. This technique also allowed me to work more fluidly with my colleagues and clients because I would be able to give them an accurate estimate of how long it would take me to do a certain task.
					<br><br>
					Personal accountability is not only important from an integrity standpoint in the workplace; I believe it is also important from a merit standpoint. I found that reputation was very important during my time at CFIA and AAFC, and a large part of reputation is acquired through accountability, independence, and work ethic. When I am held accountable for my actions, there is more pressure to do well. This motivates me to complete tasks efficiently and completely. In the workplace, holding yourself accountable for your actions lets you build a reputation among your colleagues. As for my co-op work term, this is especially important because of the temporary nature of the program. One of my main goals was to leave an impression on those that I worked with, because that may be beneficial in the future after I graduate and start searching for jobs. I believe that having a good work ethic is one of the most beneficial things you can do to put yourself ahead in the workplace or job market. People notice when their colleagues work hard, which is why being aware that you are accountable for your actions can give you an edge in the contemporary work environment. As for my role as information technologist, I found that accountability was intrinsic to my role in the office. The work flow of the entire office relies on computers; therefore if I fail to do my job correctly and the computers fail to work, productivity grinds to a halt. This leaves a very bad impression – I tried to avoid this situation by any means necessary during my work term, in order to leave as good of an impression as I could. Accountability was one of the driving forces behind my work ethic.
					<br><br>
					A large part of my role as information technologist was to interact with clients and colleagues, and assist them with technical problems with their devices such as smartphones or computers. My goal for the work term was to be as friendly and professional to these people as possible, in order to maximize workplace happiness and function well with other parties. One way I would do this was to always wish people a happy weekend or good morning, even if I was in a rush or the matter was urgent. For example, there was one instance where I had to send a mass email to the office notifying clients of a change of hardware (HDD to SSD). This required me using fifteen to thirty minutes of their time, during which they would not be able to access their computers. I realized that this would be very inconvenient to some clients, so I made sure to word the email very politely and wish them all a good weekend. While this does not make it any less inconvenient for the clients, my hope was to be as friendly as possible in order to mitigate the stress of the hardware change. I believe that it is because I put in effort to be friendly and professional that I did not experience any significant friction between my colleagues and clients. I large part of working in a team is also dealing with supervisors. I would always be sure to respect and be friendly to my supervisors, as it is them that I would like to make an impression on. I found that being friendly was the best way to communicate information to my colleagues. For example, if time allows it I would try to strike up a casual conversation before discussing a work issue with a colleague. I believe that this allows me to communicate better because their attention is focused on me; more so than if I only talked about the work issue. This also helps to build camaraderie and friendships, which ultimately allows the entire team to work smoothly together and be more productive.
					<br><br>
					The experience I gained during this work term will definitely assist me in my future studies in computer science. My experience working with hardware and software in a real environment gave me a lot of insight into how computer science in applied in the work place. I will be using the new found knowledge in 300 and 400 level computer science courses during the fall semester.
					<br><br><br>

					Section 3: Self reflection and Growth
					<br><br>
					During my time at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Agriculture Agri-Foods Canada, I had the opportunity to develop my interpersonal skills in a computer science context. Particularly, I had the opportunity to practice dealing with clients with little to no background in computer science. This was a new experience because I am used to dealing with my fellow students and professors when applying my skills in computer science; taking the time to slow down and explain what I was doing to clients is a valuable skill I learned during my placement. Because I was working on a team of information technologists, I also got to practice problem solving in a team environment. I found this different than working on group projects in the classroom because these were real situations that we were dealing with – there was more pressure to solve the problem quickly. Because of this, I also learned a lot about time management and managing work flow around other people's schedule. In my independent studies I can work on my own schedule; however during my work placement I constantly had to work around other people's schedules. This gave me valuable experience functioning as a team, and managing time in a team environment.
					<br><br>
					To be successful as an information technologist, there are several skills that are necessary to have. Firstly, strong interpersonal skills are absolutely essential. My role in both the CFIA office and the AAFC office were primarily client-based, therefore it would be extremely problematic to lack the necessary communication skills to work with both clients and peers. I found that during my four month placement, my interpersonal skills improved greatly because I was using them every day. Another essential skill needed to be successful in the workplace is time management. It can be overwhelming starting a new job in the field of information technology; therefore a prior knowledge and competency of time management is necessary in order to be successful. In information technology in particular, a comprehensive on-hand knowledge of computer software, languages, and hardware are beneficial to one's work flow. Knowing how to diagnose a bug from knowledge alone is incredibly useful, because it negates the need to research the problem and further lengthening the time it takes to solve it. This is an essential part of being a competent worker in the field of information technology.
					<br><br>
					I realized many of my strengths and weaknesses during this work term. I believe that my strengths lie in my ability to be patient with clients, my friendliness towards colleagues and clients, and my deep understanding of computer systems. As for my weaknesses, I believe my main problem was communicating work-related information in a comprehensive and efficient manner. I often found myself repeating my sentences to clients. In the future I will slow down when communicating to colleagues and clients, and comprehensively explain ideas to them at a slower pace. Communication is an essential part of being a good worker, especially when working in a team and dealing with clients as an information technologist does. Another weakness I noticed was my eagerness to be assigned tasks and projects. During my work term I wanted to take on as many jobs as I could, in order to make a good impression on the supervisors and my peers. However, this could actually be detrimental to my work flow. There were several occasions where I took on too many tasks – I find that this can distract me from each individual task, because I am trying to process later tasks while working on my current one.
					<br><br>
					I found that I favoured working with hardware during my work term. I enjoyed using my hands, rather than typing on a keyboard for extended periods of time. For example, I was assigned a project in which I had to replace several hard disk drives with solid state drives. This required that I physically switch the two devices on several computers and transfer user information from the old drive to the new drive. This was refreshing as I got to employ hands on, physical skills as well as my skills with software. In the future, I may be interested in pursuing a specialization a hardware field of study. Another skill I enjoyed employing was dealing with clients. I thoroughly enjoyed building relationships with my co-workers in a professional environment. This gave me an interest in business relations in a computer science context, and may lead me to pursue classes in which I get to work as part of a team. My preferred style of management was one where I was left to work independently, yet having a supervisor available if I had any questions. This allowed me to learn by myself, as well as build working relations with my team members. My preferred placement for my next work term would ideally be one where I get to employ hands-on skills with computer hardware, in a team environment. I believe that this would offer me the most opportunity to build on my skills and interests in the field of computer science.
					<br><br>
					Given my experience during this work-term, I now have an updated knowledge of what to talk about in a job interview. I believe that specific examples of knowledge I have employed in a real work place environment are great things to talk about during an interview. For example, bringing up the hardware update I implemented during my work term would be a good talking point during a job interview. Specific knowledge of computer systems was essential for my role as information technologists; therefore I believe that giving specific examples of fields of study I am familiar with is a good way to stand out in an interview.

				<h2>Best Decision Ever</h2>
				<em>October 7th, 2016</em>
				<p>
					October 7th, 2016 was the day I made the most important decision of my life - to do student exchange. This was a hard decision and I ultimately made a pros vs cons list to weigh the decision. It would allow me to travel Europe, make valuable lifelong connections with those I meet, and improve my resume, but it would be a large investment and I would sacrifice a teaching assistant placement. I ultimately decided to do student exchange in England as the pros outweighed the cons and it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I went against what everybody said, including  my parents, as they thought it was too expensive and it would not be worth sacrificing a co-op term.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="31/12/2016">
				<h2>Looking Back at 2016</h2>
				<em>December 31st, 2016</em>
				<p>
					2016 proved to be the most challenging, stressful, and rewarding year of my life so far. I accomplished an incredible amount in the span of only one year, which gives me a great amount of confidence going into 2017.
					<br><br>
					Starting in January, I traveled back from my home country of Colombia to start my first tech-related job as a Teaching Assistant. From January to April, I continued my studies and also managed to secure a second job as a Research Assistant, which is very extraordinary because during that time I was only into my second year of University, and research positions are rarely awarded to second-year students. I also managed to secure a co-op placement at a small startup in Windsor.
					<br><br>
					Near the end of the winter semester, the company I was supposed to start working with actually informed me that I could not work with them anymore due to some internal issues within the company. This really frustrated me and messed up my schedule as I already signed a lease in Windsor to stay for the co-op position, valued at $1,900. I was also dissatisfied with the co-op office with my school at the time as I lost my job before I even started it, but this was out of my control. I decided to focus 100% of my time on securing a new co-op placement and the co-op office did provide me with useful assistance. I was going into my finals with an 85-90% average for all my classes, but my marks dropped approximately 10% because I began focusing on getting a new job instead. This caused me additional stress, but it was worth the sacrifice because I ended up securing a placement in Guelph, Ontario, working at a government facility as an Information Technologist. I was also able to sublet the room I had in Windsor, allowing me to recuperate some of my losses.
					<br><br>
					During the summer, I worked in Guelph and managed to go out and enjoy every weekend. My weekends consisted of camping, visiting my friend’s cottage, skydiving, visiting downtown Toronto, and much more! I enjoyed my summer to the fullest; and created many great memories.
					<br><br>
					My Fall 2016 semester was the most difficult, stress inducing semester yet, not only because of my academics but because of all the personal projects I began working on. I also did some other valuable activities such as competing in a programming competition, networking, interviews, and trading. All of these activities combined with school it made it almost impossible to manage, but I continued to persevere and stay dedicated to achieving my goals and was able to overcome these challenges.
					<br><br>
					2016 was also a very good year for my investments in stocks. In the beginning of the year I only had $1,000 invested into CGC and Microsoft, but once I got my summer co-op position I was able to invest a lot more money. With the money I was making and reinvesting this year, my current stock portfolio is valued at $10,000, which might not seem that impressive but I have been able to use these earnings to cover my student debts and pay for my international exchange, which is a tremendous feeling.
					<br><br>
					I am really happy how this year went and what I achieved, as I managed to invest $10,000, secure experience in three tech-related jobs, and I also had a very fun year as I have gone camping, skydiving, and partying with friends which might not seem like a professional accomplishment but my main goal in life is to enjoy it, so I’m entering 2017 with a great attitude and the drive to achieve my ambitious new goals.

				<h2>The Only Way Is Essex (Student Exchange Experience)</h2>
				<em>July 12th, 2017</em>
				<p>
					They say time flies when you’re having fun! My six months in Europe went by so quickly, and I still can’t believe it’s over already! Student exchange has been the best experience of my life, but it has also been eye opening. I traveled to fifteen countries during my trip, and experienced their unique cultures and lifestyles. I have walked on yellow, white, red, and even black sand all across Europe and even had the opportunity to see a volcano erupt in the middle of Mediterranean Sea – something only a lucky few witness in their lifetime. I partied in Ibiza while staying in an extravagant mansion with friends from all around the world. I also backpacked by the Italian coastline where I would sleep on the beach, which was so rewarding! I did a road trip across Canada and the United States with my best friend. I jumped from cliffs in Cinque Terre that could have potentially destroyed my life. I witnessed the longest jager-bomb train in the world, went into the baths of Hungary, tried water hover boarding in Greece, partied with the Portuguese people on the Feast of St Anthony, spray painted the John Lennon wall in Prague and much more! I could continue to describe my experiences but this would become an essay worthy of a thesis presentation!
					<br><br>
					The best experience I have had while on this exchange is meeting the other exchange students in Essex. I have met so many amazing people from all around the world. I believe this is because we all think alike in some way. Most of us on student exchange seeked out this opportunity, showing a willingness for adventure, challenges, and the unknown. I believe most people who do student exchange are open-minded, who are optimistic towards everything they do in life. We are all culturally different, come from completely different time zones, and have different type of pigments. I made such a diverse and unique group of friends, who I will never forget. I know that whenever I’m in their city, I have a place to stay because of the relationships I’ve made.
					<br><br>
					University has been the best years of my life so far! First year, I lived in a student residence where I had a fantastic time making unforgettable memories and got to experience not being dependent on my parents for the first time. Second year, I lived together with my friends and experienced my first few jobs in the program I am studying. This year I was able to move to a completely different continent and still continue to thrive. My family continues congratulating me on my success and my friends wish they lived the life I have had so far. I also now have a new group of lifelong friends around the world who think just like me. I WILL continue to thrive and succeed in the next few years. I will also do my best to do another exchange experience before I graduate.				</p>

				<h2>Chapter 21: Don’t Let Your Dreams Be Dreams  </h2>
				<em>July 20th, 2017</em>
				<p>
					University has been the best years of my life so far! First year, I lived in a student residence where I had a fantastic time making unforgettable memories and got to experience not being dependent on my parents for the first time. Second year, I lived together with my friends and experienced my first few jobs in the program I am studying. This year I was able to move to a completely different continent and still continue to thrive.

I WILL continue to thrive and succeed in the next few years. I will also do my best to do another exchange experience before I graduate.
					<br><br>
					This year was also a fantastic year in terms of my stock investments. With the money I was making and reinvesting this year, my current stock portfolio is valued at $5,000, which might not seem that impressive but I have been able to use these earnings to cover my student debts and pay for my international exchange, which is a tremendous feeling.
					<br><br>
					I am really happy how this year went and what I achieved, as I managed to invest $5,000, secure experience in tech-related jobs, and I also had a very fun year as I have gone camping, skydiving, and partying with friends which might not seem like a professional accomplishment but my main goal in life is to enjoy it, so I’m entering the next year of my life with a great attitude and the drive to achieve my ambitious new goals.
					<br><br>
					During the last year, I accomplished so much that it seems almost impossible to find greater success this year. I was able to accomplish so much because I set smart short-term and long-term goals for myself. The reason I create short-term goals is because I use them as checkpoints in order to reach my long- term goals. Here is a list of my long-term goals and how I am going to fulfill these achievements.
					<br><br>
					A long-term goal of mine is to improve my personal blog, through using more organized posting and new high-quality content, so that my following increases. I plan on making it better by splitting my monthly post into two different posts in order to make it more convenient and accessible for my followers. I also want to add videos of my experiences to my blog whenever I have the opportunity; this is another reason why I bought an action camera.
					<br><br>
					My most important long-term goal is to acquire three different assets in order to make passive income. This is because I do not want to rely on a day job as my sole source of income for the rest of my life. I plan to start making passive income from my blog, by adding ads of the books I read about the stock market like “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” by Robert Kiyosaki. The reason I don’t currently have ads is because my current blog is actually just an extension of my biographical website josealba.org. I just bought a domain and pointed that domain to the extension of my website that contains my blog. This is why whenever you change pages the URL does not change. The reason I have not done this yet is because I don’t know if I want to rent another server to run my website. Another way I plan on making passive income is by investing in dividend stocks. I also want to make money from YouTube by adding my videos but this will be very hard so it will most likely be a different way.
					<br><br>
					Another goal of mine is to develop apps for iPhone or Android smartphones. I want to do this as I study Computer Science, but have almost no knowledge of app development. By developing apps it will develop valuable new skills to add to my CV and I think it would be a project I would enjoy to work on. My friend and I, have also been brainstorming on an app and we will begin developing it starting September 2017.
					<br><br>
					Even though I have these short and long term goals, I will still accomplish my biggest goal which is to enjoy life. I am 21 now and plan on enjoying my youth to its maximum. I am looking into some internships opportunities around the world that way I can travel and continue my professional career simultaneously. I know I have lots of potential and in order to continue thriving in my career, I have to continue working hard. This is why I have promised myself to not consume any alcohol until I get my next internship/co-op.

					During the last school year I worked as a co-op student and I want to continue gaining industry relevant work experience. I am driven and independent, and can work effectively in a group environment. I have superb customer relations skills, and can handle conflict effectively. I can multitask and effectively prioritize to accomplish objectives with a positive attitude and strong work ethic. I’m open-minded to new learning experiences and would like the opportunity to gain industry-specific knowledge.

					In terms of school I have also volunteered for the University multiple times and even received a reward for it - School Involvement Award. I plan on promoting my wonderful experience of student exchange across campus that way our exchange facility can continue to grow. I plan to do this by promoting my video of my exchange experience and tell everybody about my positive experience. I also applied to be the President of the Computer Science Facility but I did not get in. This will not stop me from helping students and I have already taken initiative as I am volunteering for frosh week. I have received Honour Roll during the last few years and am confident that I will continue to help the school as I have during the last year.
					<br><br>
					University has been the best years of my life so far! First year, I lived in a student residence where I had a fantastic time making unforgettable memories and got to experience not being dependent on my parents for the first time. Second year, I lived together with my friends and experienced my first few jobs in the program I am studying. This year I was able to move to a completely different continent and still continue to thrive. My family continues congratulating me on my success and my friends wish they lived the life I have had so far. I also now have a new group of lifelong friends around the world who think just like me. I WILL continue to thrive and succeed in the next few years. I will also do my best to do another exchange experience before I graduate. This year proved to be the most challenging, stressful, and rewarding year of my life so far. I accomplished an incredible amount in the span of one year, that I have a great amount of confidence going into my next school year.
